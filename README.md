## Installation
1. Download the zip file from the <a href="https://github.com/islamghost1/ApexSuperGlide/releases/tag/v0.3.1-beta">releases</a> page.
2. The `keyBoardConfig.json` configuration file must be in the same directory as the `ApexConf.exe`. You can modify key bindings as needed.
3. Execute the `ApexConf.exe` file.

## How to Use
1. Click `start_cycle` button to start the cycle (I usually use it for both jumping and starting the cycle).
2. When you are on the edge of that object, click `perform_the_super_Glide` button  to perform a super glide. in case of `scroll_down` event , just scroll the mouse wheel.
3. When you're done, click `stop_the_program` button to stop the program.
4. Enjoy.
